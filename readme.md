  DA Boilerplate
</h1>

## Description

A really awesome starting point for creating bespoke WordPress websites.

Uses Gulp for asset compilation and browsersync, but is otherwise a simple 'traditional' WP boilerplate. No build processes for working with React-based Gutenberg blocks, this uses ACF for custom block creation. No Bedrock or other Composer-based PHP dependency management either - just add plugins via admin UI as normal and leverage Manage WP for an easier maintenance workflow.

## Docs

Coming soon

## Requirements

Gulp process is currently using node v11.6.0 (npm v6.9.0)
